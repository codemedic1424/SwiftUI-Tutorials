# Learning Log (Project Root)

This is the central log for progress across all chapters.

## How to use
- Add an entry after each tutorial step or milestone.
- Link to the tutorial page when helpful.
- Keep short bullets of what you learned and any gotchas.

## 2025-10-24 — Landmarks Tutorial — Detail View Complete
- Built the detail layout with MapView, CircleImage, and text sections.
- Practiced SwiftUI layout with VStack/HStack/Spacer.
- Used .foregroundStyle(.green) for the title and .foregroundStyle(.secondary) for subheadline text.
- Added Divider and section titles using .font(.title2).

### Next ideas
- Prefer semantic styles where possible.
- Add accessibility labels to images and controls.
- Prepare for lists/navigation (NavigationStack, model).

Note: If another LEARNING.md exists under a chapter folder (e.g., CreatingAndCombiningViews), that copy can be deleted to avoid confusion. Keep this root-level file as the single source of truth.
